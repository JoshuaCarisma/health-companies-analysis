# health-companies-analysis
A project analyzing health companies using Python and Pandas

I found the data from https://www.businessofapps.com/data/fitness-app-market/
Then I combined the separate tables to analyze

I searched for trends in the market, finding that since 2020 there is growth in the fitness and wellness app space, particularly in mental health.

I found that mental health app subscrription dramatically increased during the years of the COVID-19 lockdown (2020-2022)
I also found that MyFitnessPal has the highest brand awareness and subscription base compared to the rest of the leading apps.
